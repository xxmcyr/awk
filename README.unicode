Hi, Arnold --

Finally, with a bit of spare time after the academic
treadmill slows, I have gotten back to futzing around with
Unicode in awk.  I now have it mostly working (modulo
inadequate tests), through a combination of using utf-8
internally for functions like length(), and conversion to
utf-32 in regular expressions.  The amount of actual change
isn't too great, so I think this might be ok.

I have not looked at range matches for regular expressions,
since require a lot of really fiddly code.  I have not fixed
the fnematch() code since I never noticed it before.  It
looks like the ranges will work as is; fnematch needs fixed
but I think it should be fairly easy.

There is one realloc bug, which suggests that others lurk
too, but it's confined to very large character classes, so I
should be able to find it.

I have tested this a fair amount but clearly more tests are
needed.  I'm working on that, but if you have more tests
hidden away, let me know.

Once I figure out how (and do some more checking, I will try
to submit a pull request.  I wish I understood git better,
but in spite of your help, I still don't have a proper
understanding, so this may take a while.

Hope all is well and you're enjoying your visit to the US.

Brian
